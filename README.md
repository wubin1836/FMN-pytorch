# Feedback Memroy Network 

The feedback memories and the query sequence are then combined to suggest queries by the sequence-to-sequence neural network. Modeling user feedback makes it possible to suggest diverse queries for the same query sequence if users have preferred di erent search results, which in- dicate di erent information needs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

pytorch ...

## Running the tests

pre_process.py : change data from word2idx

train.py       : use config.py set paramter and train FMN model

predict.py     : get predict score using FMN model

### Break down into end to end tests
